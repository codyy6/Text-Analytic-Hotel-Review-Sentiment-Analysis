スタッフの対応、設備は文句なしで最高でした。近くのショッピングセンターまで、徒歩圏内ですが、女性二人だったため、ホテルマンがショッピングセンターまでエスコートしてくれるほど、気配りがありました。ただ、帰りは、すぐ近くといえども、女性二人で歩くのは危険なので、タクシーが必要でした。ホテルの前は大通りということもあり、渋滞が酷く、ほんの2、3分の場所でも、１５分かかってしまう感じだったので、立地で選ぶのであれば、fxの方が良いと感じました。ただ、ホテルに戻って、リラックスしたいという目的があれば、お勧めします。ホテル内は、まるでエステのような良い匂いが漂っており、プールも綺麗で空いておりリラックスできました。,positive
